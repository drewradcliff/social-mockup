# Activity: Style a Social Network Header
A web developer will often start with a *sketch*, *mockup*, or *wireframe* showing what the page is supposed to look like. This could be as simple as a hand-drawn sketch on a piece of paper, or it could be a detailed diagram drawn by a designer. In either case, the developer will use this mockup as a guide, and write HTML and CSS to produce the desired layout.

You will now create an HTML page replicating the design shown below: a header for a social network site. Use what you have learned about the box model and how to position elements using CSS. The blue header should be exactly 850 pixels wide, and centered within the full width of the screen.

Commit your finished page to a new GitLab repository titled _SocialMockup_.
